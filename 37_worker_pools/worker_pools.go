// in thsi example we'll look at how to implement a worker pool using goroutines and channels
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// here's a worker, of which we'll run several concurrent instances. these workers will recieve work on the jobs channel and send the corresponding results on results. we'll sleep a second per job to simulate an expensive task
func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
	for j := range jobs {
		fmt.Println("worker", id, "started job", j)
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		fmt.Println("worker", id, "finished job", j)
		results <- j * 2
	}
}

func main() {
	const numJobs = 5
	// in order to use our pool of workers we need to send them work and collect their results. we make 2 channels for this
	jobs := make(chan int, numJobs)
	results := make(chan int, numJobs)

	// this starts up 3 workers, initially blocked because there are no jobs yet
	for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
		go worker(w, jobs, results)
	}

	// here we send 5 jobs and then close that channel to indicate that's all the work we have
	for j := 1; j <= numJobs; j++ {
		jobs <- j
	}
	close(jobs)

	// finally we collect all the results of the work. this also ensures that the worker goroutines have finished. an alternative way to wait for multiple goroutines is to use a WaitGroup
	for a := 1; a <= numJobs; a++ {
		<-results
	}
}

// our running program shows the 5 jobs being excuted by various workers. the program only takes about 2 seconds despite doing about 5 seconds of total work because there are 3 workers operating concurrently
